How to run a file?

Open <i>C:/cygwin64/home/yooge/.bashrc</i> file and paste variables that are inside env.sh file<br>
Open cgywin, go upto the perf_k6 folder and run below command:

> npm run dev

By the way in ubuntu, you set your variables as environment variables by doing below command and hence you don't need go upto <i>.bashrc</i> file to paste those environment variables. That will automatically be picked up after the below command :

> source env.sh
